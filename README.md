## Tutorial

For Windows users, we highly recommend to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Here's the instructions to set it up:

- [Install WSL](./wsl.md)

For Mac/Linux and those who have installed WSL on Windows:

- [Install Miniconda](./miniconda.md)
- [Conda Environments](./environments.md)
